          Hi, my name is Gino! I'm a Staff Software Engineer experienced in full
          stack web development. I spent five great years at Bloomberg, learning
          how to engineer large scale systems across a number of teams. I
          specialized in frontend development using React and NodeJS. Now I'm at
          a medical technology company focused on backend development.
        </p>

          class="profile-pic"
        />
        <p>
          While I use TypeScript/JavaScript and Python the most, I love learning
          new languages and technology. Software engineering is constantly
          evolving which means there's always something new and exciting to
          learn. I have used Java extensively and am familiar with C, C++,
          Swift. I'm fond of functional languages and would love to spend more
          time to become proficient in one or two of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from University at Buffalo
          in 2016 but have been programming and interested in computing since I
          was in highschool. My first real program was a console version of
          Snake written in C++ when I was a Junior in high school. I find joy in
          getting to build something that hasn't been built before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work I love to run and am currently training back up to a
          half marathon. I've also gotten into 3D printing and have been
          designing 3D models in CAD and Blender to print. I love tinkering with
          embedded systems and am currently working on a couple Arduino and
          RaspberryPi projects. I'm also an avid home cook and would love to
          hear your favorite recipes.
        </p>

          interested in my current resume or projects and learning I'm doing.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Currently migrating an asynchronous job system to Celery to push
                medical images and information to hospital systems in a more
                scalable and observable way.
              </li>
              <li>
                Participating in a cross-functional group tasked with setting
                the vision for cloud engineering, prioritizing technical debt,
                adopting new technologies, and addressing engineering issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                Became a subject matter expert in DICOM, HL7, and FHIR to build
                and support systems that facilitate the transfer of medical
                information. Made changes to an open-source DICOM library to
                reduce the memory footprint by streaming large pixel data out of
                memory.
              </li>
              <li>
                Proactively improved the customer experience by making key
                optimizations such as identifying, analyzing, and optimizing
                expensive queries on the critical path and in some cases
                completely migrating tables. Query performance improvements
                decreased response times from minutes to milliseconds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a CLI tool that enables developers to deploy their
                local code to an EKS cluster, significantly reducing cycle time.
                This tool speeds up debugging time from days to hours and allows
                live testing before merging into the main branch, helping to
                catch bugs and integration issues early.
              </li>
              <li>
                Championed a proposal to unify logging across cloud
                microservices to increase observability, enable more
                comprehensive alarming, and allow for quicker discovery of root
                causes of production issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                Onboarded and contributed to a SwiftUI app within 1 month. Wrote
                interactive animations and wizards using the IOS Animation
                framework.

              <li>
                Technical lead for client facing projects in which I was
                responsible for collaborating with engineering and business
                teams, proactively identifying dependencies and risks, as well
                as contributing code. Successfully delivered three projects on
                time including one that led to an initial $350K contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                Architected and led development on a modular React application
                that could be deployed within two separate enterprise portals by
                using the Context API to inject host specific implementations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leader in the Bloomberg web community which involved providing
                guidance on best practices and contributing to inner source
                initiatives across the firm such as a shared component library.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed several high traffic client facing JSON-LD REST API
                endpoints using Python, Flask, and Marshmallow allowing clients
                to search and request enterprise data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Optimized both the frontend and backend of a full stack web
                application. Examples include reducing the rendering of 70K+
                items from minutes to milliseconds and reducing implementation
                costs of common tasks from weeks to days by re-architecturing
                how we create CRUD features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed Jenkins CI/CD workflows to ensure reliable software
                releases. Workflows include automating the verification,
                packaging, and deployment of various software.

          <p>
            This was my first large scale 3D printed project. I designed the
            base and tubes in CAD using Fusion 360 and printed them on my Bambu
            A1 Mini.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each tube is wired with a strip of 4 NeoPixels that are soldered
            together. The NeoPixels are controlled via a RaspberryPi (although
            its on my list to change that to an Arduino). The whole thing is
            mounted on 2' x 2' plywood back.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also designed and printed a button panel. Each button is a tactile
            switch that sends an input signal to the controller. These inputs
            control the brightness, animation shown, and changes animation
            "modes". There are several animations I made: a DFS starting from a
            random point and traveling to another point, an animation with
            several independent moving "snakes" that travel through the maze,
            and a fill animation.

          </div>
          <p>
            HackrWave was a hackathon project I did during university in which
            my team tried to turn a regular microwave into a smart microwave. We
            wanted to be able to scan any barcode and have the microwave
            correctly cook the food based on what it was.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project consisted of a Raspberry PI that was connected to the
            microwave's circuit board, a flask API running on the raspberry pi
            that could accept commands and send them to the microwave, and an
            app that could scan a barcode and send a request to the flask
            server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite not knowing much about hardware or reverse engineering
            circuit boards, we were able to successfully send commands to the
            microwave to input a time, power level, and start and stop it all
            through a mobile application.

            I attended a talk at a conference once where the presenter talked
            about how they strive to "learn in the open" for others to see. I
            think there's a lot of value in taking what you learn and putting it
            in your own words to really cement your understanding. My goal is to
            <i>try</i> to do just that here.

          <p>
            Currently I'm reading two excellent books:
            <a href="https://staffeng.com/book/" target="_blank"
              >Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will
              Larson</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://g.co/kgs/JnNofUY" target="_blank"
              >A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout</a
            >. Both have had some really great ideas in them that I hope to
            write down soon.
