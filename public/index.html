          Hi, my name is Gino! I'm a Staff Software Engineer experienced in full
          stack web development. I spent five great years at Bloomberg, learning
          how to engineer large scale systems across a number of teams. I
          specialized in frontend development using React and NodeJS. Now I'm at
          a medical technology company focused on backend development.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I use TypeScript/JavaScript and Python the most, I love learning
          new languages and technology. Software engineering is constantly
          evolving which means there's always something new and exciting to
          learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from University at Buffalo
          in 2016 but have been programming and interested in computing since I
          was in highschool. My first real program was a console version of
          Snake written in C++ when I was a Junior in high school. I find joy in
          getting to build something that hasn't been built before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work I love to run and am currently training back up to a
          half marathon. I've also gotten into 3D printing and have been
          designing 3D models in CAD and Blender to print. I love tinkering with
          embedded systems and am currently working on a couple Arduino and
          RaspberryPi projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for checking my website! Check the links above if you are
          interested in my current resume or projects and learning I'm doing.
          Feel free to get in touch with me at the contact info above.

              Butterfly Network, Inc - Staff Software Engineer (2021 - Present)
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Currently migrating an asynchronous job system to Celery to push
                medical images and information to hospital systems in a more
                scalable and observable way.
              </li>
              <li>
                Participating in a cross-functional group tasked with setting
                the vision for cloud engineering, prioritizing technical debt,
                adopting new technologies, and addressing engineering issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                Became a subject matter expert in DICOM, HL7, and FHIR to build
                and support systems that facilitate the transfer of medical
                information. Made changes to an open-source DICOM library to
                reduce the memory footprint by streaming large pixel data out of
                memory.
              </li>
              <li>
                Proactively improved the customer experience by making key
                optimizations such as identifying, analyzing, and optimizing
                expensive queries on the critical path and in some cases
                completely migrating tables. Query performance improvements
                decreased response times from minutes to milliseconds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a CLI tool that enables developers to deploy their
                local code to an EKS cluster, significantly reducing cycle time.
                This tool speeds up debugging time from days to hours and allows
                live testing before merging into the main branch, helping to
                catch bugs and integration issues early.
              </li>
              <li>
                Championed a proposal to unify logging across cloud
                microservices to increase observability, enable more
                comprehensive alarming, and allow for quicker discovery of root
                causes of production issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                Onboarded and contributed to a SwiftUI app within 1 month. Wrote
                interactive animations and wizards using the IOS Animation
                framework.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Technical lead for client facing projects in which I was
                responsible for collaborating with engineering and business
                teams, proactively identifying dependencies and risks, as well
                as contributing code. Successfully delivered three projects on
                time including one that led to an initial $350K contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                Architected and led development on a modular React application
                that could be deployed within two separate enterprise portals by
                using the Context API to inject host specific implementations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leader in the Bloomberg web community which involved providing
                guidance on best practices and contributing to inner source
                initiatives across the firm such as a shared component library.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed several high traffic client facing JSON-LD REST API
                endpoints using Python, Flask, and Marshmallow allowing clients
                to search and request enterprise data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Optimized both the frontend and backend of a full stack web
                application. Examples include reducing the rendering of 70K+
                items from minutes to milliseconds and reducing implementation
                costs of common tasks from weeks to days by re-architecturing
                how we create CRUD features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed Jenkins CI/CD workflows to ensure reliable software
                releases. Workflows include automating the verification,
                packaging, and deployment of various software.

              <li>
                Utilized PHP Symfony and Doctrine ORM to serve AJAX requests to
