        <h3>Hack-R-Wave - Retrofitted Smart Microwave</h3>
        <p>
          Hack-R-Wave was a hackathon project in which my team tried to turn a
          regular microwave into a smart microwave. We wanted to be able to scan
          any barcode and have the microwave correctly cook the food based on
          what it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project consisted of a Raspberry PI that was connected to the
          microwave's circuit board, a flask API running on the raspberry pi
          that could accept commands and send them to the microwave, and an app
          that could scan a barcode and send a request to the flask server.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Worked on a team of four people to turn a regular microwave into a
            "smart" microwave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reverse engineered how the microwave processed button presses.
            Created circuitry that allowed a Raspberry PI to send commands to
            the microwave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created an Android app that could read a barcode and send commands
            remotely to the Raspberry PI. These commands would set the cook time
            and turn on the microwave.

        <h3>Budgeting App - Progressive Web Application for Home Budgeting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Progressive web application built with ReactJS and Firebase that
            tracked spending.
          </li>
          <li>
            Features included being able to set spending goals, savings goals,
            adding transactions, graphing monthly and yearly spending, and
            creating recurring transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recurring transactions implemented using Firebase's serverless
            functions. The function checks the database every 15 minutes to see
            if transaction needs to be added.
