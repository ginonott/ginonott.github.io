              A progressive web application that helped my wife and I keep track
              of our monthly spending and our savings goal. It used Firebase's
              no SQL DB to store login information, transactions, and other user
              data. React was used for the view layer and Redux was used to keep
              components in sync as a lot of components relied on the same
              global information. I used Firebase serverless functions to
              schedule and execute reoccurring transactions that could be
              scheduled on the client. Local storage was used to cache
              information to reduce database usage. It was also hosted via
              firebase. Google Authentication was used for login.

                >wedding RSVP website.</a
              >
              It used PugJS to compile together a set of various pug templates
              into static HTML. The HTML was hosted on netlify and came with a
              minimal amount of Javascript to post RSVPs into the firebase no
              sql DB. I also put together a small React app to view the RSVPs
              easily as well as filter them.

            <h3>HackerWave - Retrofitted Smart Microwave</h3>
            <p>
              HackerWave was a group project built during a 48 hour hackathon at
              Cornell. Our idea was to take a microwave and embed a RaspberryPI
              so that we could scan a barcode on a pre-made meal such as hot
              pockets and have the microwave know exactly how to cook it
              perfectly. The project consisted of a flask server that hosted an
              HTTP service, an android app that would read a barcode and send
              the barcode information to the microwave, and the code that would
              interact with the circuitry of the microwave via GPIO pins. To
              make it more difficult and comical, the microwave was from the
              1980s and had no wiring diagrams or schematics. I helped decode
              the voltage signals needed to program the microwave. We used the
              RaspberryPI to plug into the same circuits that the number pad
              plugged into. We measured the voltages on the circuit board as
              buttons were pressed to figure out what signals we had to mimic.
              Once we had compiled all the possible values, we built a python
              program to output signals via the gpio pins and a circuit to
              convert the low voltage power of the RaspberryPI into the high
              voltage power used by the microwave circuit board. By the end of
              the hackathon, we had an android app that could scan barcodes,
              send them to the HTTP server, translate that to the instructions
              needed to program the microwave, and start it. Unfortunately, we
              burned out the RaspberryPI due to bad wiring (oops).
