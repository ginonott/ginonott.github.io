              Enterprise Access Point (EAP) allows clients to create, search,
              purchase, and download financial datasets. Customer Service Center
              allows users to manage their billing, reporting, create tickets,
              and other self service focused workflows.

                Developed Jenkins pipelines that automated manual processes and
                workflows such as assigning developers to Pull Requests to
                decrease review time, run new lint rules against new code, and
                rerun end to end test on failures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Deployed Selenium grid to cloud computers to allow E2E tests to
                run in parallel on multiple browsers cutting E2E test time in
                half and increasing browser coverage.

                being changed without approval.

              A progressive web application that helped my wife and I keep track
              of our monthly spending and our savings goal. It used Firebase's
              no SQL DB to store login information, transactions, and other user
              data. React was used for the view layer and Redux was used to keep
              components in sync as a lot of components relied on the same
              global information. I used Firebase serverless functions to
              schedule and execute reoccurring transactions that could be
              scheduled on the client. Local storage was used to cache
              information to reduce database usage. It was also hosted via
              firebase. Google Authentication was used for login.

              >
              It used PugJS to compile together a set of various pug templates
              into static HTML. The HTML was hosted on netlify and came with a
              minimal amount of Javascript to post RSVPs into the firebase no

              pockets and have the microwave know exactly how to cook it

              The project consisted of a flask server that hosted an HTTP
              service, an android app that would read a barcode and send the
              barcode information to the microwave, and the code that would
              interact with the circuitry of the microwave via GPIO pins. To
              make it more difficult and comical, the microwave was from the
              1980s and had no wiring diagrams or schematics. I helped decode
              the voltage signals needed to program the microwave. We used the
              RaspberryPI to plug into the same circuits that the number pad
              plugged into. We measured the voltages on the circuit board as
              buttons were pressed to figure out what signals we had to mimic.
              Once we had compiled all the possible values, we built a python
              program to output signals via the gpio pins and a circuit to
              convert the low voltage power of the RaspberryPI into the high
              voltage power used by the microwave circuit board. By the end of
              the hackathon, we had an android app that could scan barcodes,
              send them to the HTTP server, translate that to the instructions
              needed to program the microwave, and start it. Unfortunately, we
              burned out the RaspberryPI due to bad wiring (oops).

          I'm a professional full stack software engineer that really enjoys
          building frontend applications by working on every part of the stack
          currently based in New York City. I've worked with numerous
          technologies but primarily Typescript / Javascript and python.
          Bloomberg has its fair share of C++ code and as a result, I've worked
          with C++ as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from University at Buffalo with a Bachelors of Sciences in
          May of 2016. From there I started working at Bloomberg on a customer
          self service portal. After a while I switched to my current project
          which is an enterprise application focused on allow clients to
          discover, purchase, and download datasets as well as create their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before graduating I interned at Bloomberg as well as being a teaching
          assistant for 3 years for the intro to computer science class. I
          greatly enjoyed working with students and helping them to learn Java
          and broader topics such as object oriented programming and data
          structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy cooking new dishes and running amongst other
          hobbies. I'm in the process of making my way through a cookbook on
          souther Italian cooking. For a while I ran with the Leukemia and
          Lymphoma Society using Bloomberg's generous policy of being able to
          donate money earned by volunteering. I've met some amazing people and
          ran 2 marathons and numerous half marathons. In the process, I've
          gotten to volunteer at a number of incredible organizations that
          include food pantries, parks services, and teaching code to children.
